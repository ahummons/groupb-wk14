            3D printing is an educational technology that is valuable across multiple disciplines. The Rebecca Crown Library staff is
            here to assist faculty with incorporating 3D printing into their courses. A librarian can work with you to create
            an assignment or simply provide you students with an instruction session in the 3D lab.
          </p>

          <h3> Liasions</h3>
          <p>
            You can speak with a library liaison for your department who can help you work with the instructional design team for a Design
            Consultation. As a team we can work together to create a project that meets the learning objectives of your course.
            3D printing is an exciting way to incorporate emerging technology into you class.

            <p>3D printing is already being used at universities across the country for course work. In the above video, Dr. Marlo Steed, education faculty at the University of Louisville, explains how 3D printing is a tool that helps students explore and experience new and existing concepts. 3D printing is a tactile learning tool that can helps students visualize concepts in the classroom. 3D printing is a great tool to help the students of our visual culture access curriculums at the university level.</p>
