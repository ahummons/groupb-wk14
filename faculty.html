            3D printing is an educational technology that is valuable across multiple disciplines. The Rebecca Crown Library staff is
            here to assist faculty with incorporating 3D printing into their courses. A librarian can work with you to create
            an assignment or simply provide you students with an instruction session in the 3D lab.
          </p>

          <h3> Liasions</h3>
          <p>
            You can speak with a library liaison for your department who can help you work with the instructional design team for a Design
            Consultation. As a team we can work together to create a project that meets the learning objectives of your course.
            3D printing is an exciting way to incorporate emerging technology into you class.
