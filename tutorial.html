        <h3> Step 1: Preparing your object</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a model of your object</li>
          <li>Make an appointment with Dominican's Media Center to download previously created objects.</li>
          <li>2 hour blocks are designated for appointments</li>
          <li> Create objects of your selection and save as .STL or .OBJ files</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Specifications</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Models created in the Media Center can be printed immedialtely when time allots. If students or faculty are unable to print, files will be saved
             on Media Center computers as soon as possible. Email confirmations will be sent when objects are ready for pickup.</li>
          <li>All printing requests must be sent to mediacenter@dom.edu</li>
          <li>Please allow five days for processing</li>
          <li>Dominican's Media Center specifies 3D objects "must not exceeed 9 inches across, 6 inches deep, and 5.7 inches
            tall"
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3> Saving Copies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Files submitted will be deleted after printing is complete. Remember all objects are "printed as is." If troubleshooting is required, contact the Media  staff for assistance. A complete object does not indicate a perfect one; notifications will be sent if this occurs. </li>
          <li>Should printing fails because of hardware reasons or an .STL file, a second attempt will made or we can assist with fixing these files and you can print again.
        </li>
      </ul>
